# Experiment Purpose: Pro Edition

The Pro Edition of this experiment goes beyond the basics by incorporating advanced tools for automatic calculation and data analysis, providing a more interactive and comprehensive learning experience. This version aims to enhance participants' understanding of Earth's rotational speed and its relationship with geographical location, while offering additional features for a deeper exploration of Earth's physical properties.

## Experiment Objectives:
1. **Advanced Automatic Calculations**: The Pro Edition includes automatic calculation of the local Earth's radius based on the user's latitude using the WGS84 model. Participants will learn how to calculate the radius and rotational speed without manually entering data, making the process faster and more accurate.

2. **In-depth Analysis of Time Differences**: The Pro version allows for the automatic calculation of time differences between consecutive observations over several nights. This enables participants to more accurately determine the length of a sidereal day and study its variations over time.

3. **Global Visualization of Rotation Speed**: Unlike the Standard Edition, the Pro Edition offers a global visualization that compares Earth’s rotational speed at different latitudes. By generating dynamic graphs, users can see how the speed changes from the equator to the poles, providing a clearer understanding of Earth's rotation.

4. **Real-time Data Feedback**: With automatic data analysis and visualization, participants can receive instant feedback on Earth’s rotational speed at their location. This makes the learning process more interactive, and users can immediately see the effects of changing latitude or observing different celestial objects.

5. **Comprehensive Earth Science Learning**: The Pro Edition is designed for those seeking a deeper understanding of Earth sciences, astronomy, and physics. It provides tools for calculating and visualizing not just Earth's rotational speed but also the influence of location on various physical properties.

Through this enhanced version, participants will gain a more robust understanding of the Earth's dynamics, utilize advanced computation tools, and explore the relationships between latitude, Earth's rotation, and time measurement. The Pro Edition serves as a more advanced tool for both academic learning and personal exploration in Earth and space sciences.
