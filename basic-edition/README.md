# Experiment Purpose:

The purpose of this basic edition experiment is to understand and calculate the Earth's rotational speed at a given location by observing the time difference of a specific star appearing at the same celestial position over consecutive nights. The main goal is to help students or astronomy enthusiasts grasp the methods used to calculate Earth's rotational speed, especially how observational data can be applied to real-world calculations.

## Experiment Objectives:
1. **Understand the Basics of Earth's Rotation**: The experiment aims to provide a foundational understanding of how Earth's rotational speed varies with latitude. Observing the motion of a star allows us to infer the length of a sidereal day and calculate the Earth's rotational speed.
   
2. **Calculate Earth's Rotational Speed from Observation Data**: By using an equatorial mount to track a star (such as Sirius), and recording its Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (Dec), students will calculate the Earthâ€™s rotational speed at their specific location based on time differences between consecutive nights.

3. **Latitude's Effect on Rotational Speed**: The experiment will demonstrate how Earth's rotational speed is influenced by latitude, with the speed being highest at the equator and gradually decreasing as you move toward the poles. This helps students understand the Earth's physical dynamics.

4. **Hands-on Data Analysis and Calculation**: Students will gain experience in handling astronomical data and applying it to practical calculations. The experiment offers an interactive way to explore Earth's rotational properties and the significance of latitude in determining rotational speed.

Through these steps, participants will not only learn how to calculate Earth's rotational speed but will also develop a deeper understanding of astronomical observation techniques and data analysis methods.




## Features:
- Manual data input for latitude and time differences.
- Basic calculation of Earth's rotational speed at different latitudes.
